    AttractorMapper(ds::GeneralizedDynamicalSystem, args...; kwargs...) → mapper
Subtypes of `AttractorMapper` are structures that map initial conditions of `ds` to
attractors. Currently available mapping methods:
* [`AttractorsViaProximity`](@ref)
* [`AttractorsViaRecurrences`](@ref)
* [`AttractorsViaFeaturizing`](@ref)

All `AttractorMapper` subtypes can be used with [`basins_fractions`](@ref)
or [`basins_of_attraction`](@ref).

In addition, some mappers can be called as a function of an initial condition:
```julia
label = mapper(u0)
```
and this will on the fly compute and return the label of the attractor `u0` converges at.
The mappers that can do this are:
* [`AttractorsViaProximity`](@ref)
* [`AttractorsViaRecurrences`](@ref)

"""
    basins_fractions(mapper::AttractorMapper, ics::Union{Dataset, Function}; kwargs...)

Approximate the state space fractions `fs` of the basins of attraction of a dynamical
stystem by mapping initial conditions to attractors using `mapper`
(which contains a reference to a [`GeneralizedDynamicalSystem`](@ref)).
The fractions are simply the ratios of how many initial conditions ended up
at each attractor.

Initial conditions to use are defined by `ics`. It can be:
* a `Dataset` of initial conditions, in which case all are used.
* a 0-argument function `ics()` that spits out random initial conditions.
  Then `N` random initial conditions are chosen.
  See [`statespace_sampler`](@ref) to generate such functions.

The returned arguments are `fs`.
If `ics` is a `Dataset` then the `labels` of each initial condition and roughly approximated
attractors are also returned: `fs, labels, attractors`.

The output `fs` is a dictionary whose keys are the labels given to each attractor
(always integers enumerating the different attractors), and the
values are their respective fractions. The label `-1` is given to any initial condition
where `mapper` could not match to an attractor (this depends on the `mapper` type).
`attractors` has the same structure, mapping labels to `Dataset`s.

See [`AttractorMapper`](@ref) for all possible `mapper` types.

## Keyword arguments
* `N = 1000`: Number of random initial conditions to generate in case `ics` is a function.
* `show_progress = true`: Display a progress bar of the process.

"""
    basins_of_attraction(mapper::AttractorMapper, grid::Tuple) → basins, attractors
Compute the full basins of attraction as identified by the given `mapper`,
which includes a reference to a [`GeneralizedDynamicalSystem`](@ref) and return them
along with (perhaps approximated) found attractors.

`grid` is a tuple of ranges defining the grid of initial conditions that partition
the state space into boxes with size the step size of each range.
For example, `grid = (xg, yg)` where `xg = yg = range(-5, 5; length = 100)`.
The grid has to be the same dimensionality as the state space expected by the
integrator/system used in `mapper`. E.g., a [`projected_integrator`](@ref)
could be used for lower dimensional projections, etc. A special case here is
a [`poincaremap`](@ref) with `plane` being `Tuple{Int, <: Real}`. In this special
scenario the grid can be one dimension smaller than the state space, in which case
the partitioning happens directly on the hyperplane the Poincaré map operates on.

`basins_of_attraction` function is a convenience 5-lines-of-code wrapper which uses the
`labels` returned by [`basins_fractions`](@ref) and simply assings them to a full array
corresponding to the state space partitioning indicated by `grid`.
