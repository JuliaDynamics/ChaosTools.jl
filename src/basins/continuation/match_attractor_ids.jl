    match_attractor_ids!(a₊::AbstractDict, a₋; metric = Euclidean(), threshold = Inf)
Given dictionaries `a₊, a₋` mapping IDs to attractors (`Dataset` instances),
match attractor IDs in dictionary `a₊` so that its attractors that are the closest to
those in dictionary `a₋` get assigned the same key as in `a₋`.
Typically the +,- mean after and before some change of parameter of a system.

Return the `replacement_map`, a dictionary mapping old keys of `a₊` to
the new ones that they were mapped to. You can obtain this map, without modifying
the dictionaries, by directly calling the [`replacement_map`](@ref) function
with the output of [`datasets_sets_distances`](@ref) for given `metric`.

## Description

When finding attractors and their fractions in DynamicalSystems.jl,
different attractors get assigned different IDs. However
which attractor gets which ID is somewhat arbitrary. Finding the attractors of the
same system for slightly different parameters could label "similar" attractors (at
the different parameters) with different IDs.
`match_attractors!` tries to "match" them by modifying the attractor IDs,
i.e., the keys of the given dictionaries.

The matching happens according to the output of the [`datasets_sets_distances`](@ref)
function with the keyword `metric`. `metric` can be whatever that function accepts, such as
an actual `Metric` instance, or an arbitrary user-defined function that computes
an arbitrary "distance" between two datasets. Attractors are then match according to
distance, with unique mapping. The closest attractors (before and after) are mapped to each
other, and are removed from the matching pool, and then the next pair with least
remaining distance is matched, and so on.

Additionally, you can provide a `threshold` value. If the distance between two attractors
is larger than this `threshold`, then it is guaranteed that the attractors will get assigned
different key in the dictionary `a₊`.

Similar to [`match_attractor_ids!`](@ref) but operate on basin arrays instead
(the arrays typically returned by [`basins_of_attraction`](@ref)).

This method matches IDs of attractors whose basins of attraction before and after `b₋,b₊`
have the most overlap (in pixels). This overlap is normalized in 0-1 (with 1 meaning
100% overlap of pixels). The `threshold` in this case is compared to the inverse
of the overlap (so, for `threshold = 2` attractors that have less than 50% overlap get
different IDs guaranteed).
