# Super duper inefficient version, but quickly coding it for now.
# I am certain that there can be algorithmic optimizations, as it feels like
# operations are repetead in all these nested loops...
# Also I made my own estimate for good k values that scales them logarithmically
# as we do in our fractal dimension paper. Higuchi doesn't describe this.

    higuchi(x::AbstractVector [, ks])
Calculate the Higuchi dimension[^Higuchi1988] of the graph of `x`.

## Description
The Higuchi dimension is a number `Δ ∈ [1, 2]` that quantifies the roughness of
the graph of the function `x(t)`, assuming here that `x` is equi-sampled,
like in the original paper.

The method estimates how the length of the graph increases as a function of
the indices difference (which, in this context, is equivalent with differences in `t`).
Specifically, we calculate the average length versus `k` as
```math
L_m(k) = \\frac{N-1}{\\lfloor \\frac{N-m}{k} \rfloor k^2}
\\sum_{i=1}^{\\lfloor \\frac{N-m}{k} \\rfloor} |X_N(m+ik)-X_N(m+(i-1)k)| \\\\

L(k) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{m=1}^k L_m(k)
```
and then use [`linear_region`](@ref) in `-log2.(k)` vs `log2.(L)` as per usual
when computing a [Fractal dimension](@ref).

The algorithm chooses default `ks` to be exponentially spaced in base-2, up to at most
exponent 8. A user can provide their own `ks` as a second argument otherwise.

Use `ChaosTools.higuchi_length(x, ks)` to obtain ``L(k)`` directly.
