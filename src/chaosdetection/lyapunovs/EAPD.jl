    ensemble_averaged_pairwise_distance(ds, init_states::StateSpaceSet, T, pidx;kwargs...) -> ρ,t

Calculate the ensemble-averaged pairwise distance function `ρ` for non-autonomous dynamical systems 
with a time-dependent parameter, using the metod described by [^Jánosi, Tél]. Time-dependence is assumed to be a linear drift. The rate of change
of the parameter needs to be stored in the parameter container of the system `p = current_parameters(ds)`,
at the index `pidx`. In case of autonomous systems (with no drift), `pidx` can be set to any index as a dummy.
To every member of the ensemble `init_states`, a perturbed initial condition is assigned.
`ρ(t)` is the natural log of phase space distance between the original and perturbed states averaged 
over all pairs, calculated for all time steps up to `T`. 


## Keyword arguments

* `initial_params = deepcopy(current_parameters(ds))`: initial parameters 
* `Ttr = 0`: transient time used to evolve initial states to reach 
    initial autonomous attractor (without drift)
* `perturbation = perturbation_normal`: if given, it should be a function `perturbation(ds,ϵ)`,
   which outputs perturbed state vector of `ds` (preferrably `SVector`). If not given, a normally distributed 
   random perturbation with norm `ϵ` is added.
*  `Δt = 1`: step size 
*  `ϵ = sqrt(dimension(ds))*1e-10`: initial distance between pairs of original and perturbed initial conditions 


## Description
In non-autonomous systems with parameter drift, long time averages are less useful to assess chaoticity.
Thus, quantities using time averages are rather calculated using ensemble averages. Here, a new 
quantity called the Ensemble-averaged pairwise distance (EAPD) is used to measure chaoticity of 
the snapshot attractor/ phase space object traced out by the ensemble [^Jánosi, Tél].

To any member of the original ensemble (`init_states`) a close neighbour (test) is added at an initial distance `ϵ`. Quantity `d(t)` is the 
dimensionless phase space distance between a test particle and an ensemble member at time t .
If `init_states`` are randomly initialized (far from the attractor at the initial parameter), and there's no transient, 
the first few time steps cannot be used to calculate any reliable averages.
The function of the EAPD `ρ(t)` is defined as the average logarithmic distance between original and 
perturbed initial conditions at every time step: `ρ(t) = ⟨ln d(t)⟩`

An analog of the classical largest Lyapunov exponent can be extracted from the 
EAPD function `ρ`: the local slope can be considered an instantaneous Lyapunov exponent.

## Example
Example of a rate-dependent (linearly drifting parameter) system

```julia
#r parameter is replaced by r(n) = r0 + R*n drift term
function drifting_logistic(x,p,n)
    r0,R = p
    return SVector( (r0 + R*n)*x[1]*(1-x[1]) )
end

r0 = 3.8 #inital parameter
R = 0.001 #rate parameter
p = [r0,R] # pidx = 2

init_states = StateSpaceSet(rand(1000)) #initial states of the ensemble 
ds = DeterministicIteratedMap(drifting_logistic, [0.1], p)
ρ,times = ensemble_averaged_pairwise_distance(ds,init_states,100,2;Ttr=1000)
```
