    numericallyapunov(R::Dataset, ks;  refstates, w, distance, ntype)
Return `E = [E(k) for k ∈ ks]`, where `E(k)` is the average logarithmic distance
between states of a neighborhood that are evolved in time for `k` steps
(`k` must be integer).
Typically `R` is the result of delay coordinates of a single timeseries.

## Keyword Arguments

* `refstates = 1:(length(R) - ks[end])` : Vector of indices
  that notes which
  states of the reconstruction should be used as "reference states", which means
  that the algorithm is applied for all state indices contained in `refstates`.
* `w::Int = 1` : The [Theiler window](@ref).
* `ntype = NeighborNumber(1)` : The neighborhood type. Either [`NeighborNumber`](@ref)
  or [`WithinRange`](@ref). See [Neighborhoods](@ref) for more info.
* `distance::Metric = Cityblock()` : The distance function used in the
  logarithmic distance of nearby states. The allowed distances are `Cityblock()`
  and `Euclidean()`. See below for more info. The metric for finding neighbors is
  always the Euclidean one.


## Description
If the dataset exhibits exponential divergence of nearby states, then it should hold
```math
E(k) \\approx \\lambda\\cdot k \\cdot \\Delta t + E(0)
```
for a *well defined region* in the `k` axis, where ``\\lambda`` is
the approximated maximum Lyapunov exponent. ``\\Delta t`` is the time between samples in the
original timeseries. You can use [`linear_region`](@ref) with arguments `(ks .* Δt, E)` to
identify the slope (= ``\\lambda``) immediatelly, assuming you
have choosen sufficiently good `ks` such that the linear scaling region is bigger
than the saturated region.

The algorithm used in this function is due to Parlitz[^Skokos2016], which itself
expands upon Kantz [^Kantz1994]. In sort, for
each reference state a neighborhood is evaluated. Then, for each point in this
neighborhood, the logarithmic distance between reference state and neighborhood
state(s) is calculated as the "time" index `k` increases. The average of the above over
all neighborhood states over all reference states is the returned result.

If the `Metric` is `Euclidean()` then use the Euclidean distance of the
full `D`-dimensional points (distance ``d_E`` in ref.[^Skokos2016]).
If however the `Metric` is `Cityblock()`, calculate
the absolute distance of *only the first elements* of the `m+k` and `n+k` points
of `R` (distance ``d_F`` in ref.[^Skokos2016], useful when `R` comes from delay embedding).

    broomhead_king(s::AbstractVector, d::Int) -> U, S, Vtr
Return the Broomhead-King coordinates of a timeseries `s`
by performing `svd` on high-dimensional embedding if `s` with dimension `d` with
minimum delay.

## Description
Broomhead and King coordinates is an approach proposed in [^Broomhead1987] that applies the
Karhunen–Loève theorem to delay coordinates embedding with smallest possible delay.

The function performs singular value decomposition
on the `d`-dimensional matrix ``X`` of ``s``,
```math
X = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\left(
\\begin{array}{cccc}
x_1 & x_2 & \\ldots & x_d \\\\
x_2 & x_3 & \\ldots & x_{d+1}\\\\
\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\
x_{N-d+1} & x_{N-d+2} &\\ldots & x_N
\\end{array}
\\right) = U\\cdot S \\cdot V^{tr}.
```
where ``x := s - \\bar{s}``.
The columns of ``U`` can then be used as a new coordinate system, and by
considering the values of the singular values ``S`` you can decide how many
columns of ``U`` are "important". See the documentation page for example application.
