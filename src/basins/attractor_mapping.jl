    AttractorMapper(ds::DynamicalSystem, args...; kwargs...) â†’ mapper
Subtypes of `AttractorMapper` are structures that map initial conditions of `ds` to 
attractors. Currently available mapping methods:
* [`AttractorsViaProximity`](@ref)
* [`AttractorsViaRecurrences`](@ref)

`AttractorMapper` subtypes can always be used directly with [`basin_fractions`](@ref).

In addition, some mappers can be called as a function of an initial condition:
```julia
label = mapper(u0)
```
and this will on the fly compute and return the label of the attractor `u0` converges at.
The mappers that can do this are:
* [`AttractorsViaProximity`](@ref)
* [`AttractorsViaRecurrences`](@ref)
