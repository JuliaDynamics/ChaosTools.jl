    basin_entropy(basins, ε = 20) -> Sb, Sbb
This algorithm computes the basin entropy `Sb` of the basins of attraction.
First, the input `basins`
is divided regularly into n-dimensional boxes of side `ε` (along all dimensions).
Then `Sb` is simply the average of the Gibbs entropy computed over these boxes. The
function returns the basin entropy `Sb` as well as the boundary basin entropy `Sbb`.
The later is the average of the entropy only for boxes that contains at least two
different basins, that is, for the boxes on the boundary.

The basin entropy is a measure of the uncertainty on the initial conditions of the basins.
It is maximum at the value `log(n_att)` being `n_att` the number of attractors. In
this case the boundary is intermingled: for a given initial condition we can find
another initial condition that lead to another basin arbitriraly close. It provides also
a simple criterion for fractality: if the boundary basin entropy `Sbb` is above `log(2)`
then we have a fractal boundary. It doesn't mean that basins with values below cannot
have a fractal boundary, for a more precise test see [`basins_fractal_test`](@ref).
An important feature of the basin entropy is that it allows
comparisons between different basins using the same box size `ε`.

    basins_fractal_test(basins; ε = 20, Ntotal = 1000) -> test_res, Sbb
This is an automated test to decide if the boundary of the basins has fractal structures.
The bottom line is to look at the basins with a magnifier of size `ε` at random in `basins`.
If what we see in the magnifier looks like a smooth boundary (in average) we decide that
the boundary is smooth. If it is not smooth we can say that at the scale `ε` we have
structures, i.e., it is fractal.

In practice the algorithm computes the boundary basin entropy `Sbb` [`basin_entropy`](@ref)
for `Ntotal`
random balls of radius `ε`. If the computed value is equal to theoretical value of a smooth
boundary
(taking into account statistical errors and biases) then we decide that we have a smooth
boundary. Notice that the response `test_res` may depend on the chosen ball radius `ε`.
For larger size,
we may observe structures for smooth boundary and we obtain a *different* answer.

The output `test_res` is a symbol describing the nature of the basin and the output `Sbb` is
the estimated value of the boundary basin entropy with the sampling method.

    uncertainty_exponent(basins; kwargs...) -> ε, N_ε ,α
Estimate the uncertainty exponent[^Grebogi1983] of the basins of attraction. This exponent
is related to the final state sensitivity of the trajectories in the phase space.
An exponent close to `1` means basins with smooth boundaries whereas an exponent close
to `0` represent completely fractalized basins, also called riddled basins.

The output `N_ε` is a vector with the number of the balls of radius `ε` (in pixels)
that contain at least two initial conditions that lead to different attractors.
The ouput `α` is the estimation of the uncertainty exponent using the box-counting
dimension of the boundary by fitting a line in the `log.(N_ε)` vs `log.(1/ε)` curve.
However it is recommended to analyze the curve directly for more accuracy.

## Keyword arguments
* `range_ε = 2:maximum(size(basins))÷20` is the range of sizes of the ball to
  test (in pixels).

## Description

A phase space with a fractal boundary may cause a uncertainty on the final state of the
dynamical system for a given initial condition. A measure of this final state sensitivity
is the uncertainty exponent. The algorithm probes the basin of attraction with balls
of size `ε` at random. If there are a least two initial conditions that lead to different
attractors, a ball is tagged "uncertain". `f_ε` is the fraction of "uncertain balls" to the
total number of tries in the basin. In analogy to the fractal dimension, there is a scaling
law between, `f_ε ~ ε^α`. The number that characterizes this scaling is called the
uncertainty exponent `α`.

Notice that the uncertainty exponent and the box counting dimension of the boundary are
related. We have `Δ₀ = D - α` where `Δ₀` is the box counting dimension computed with
[`basins_fractal_dimension`](@ref) and `D` is the dimension of the phase space.
The algorithm first estimates the box counting dimension of the boundary and
returns the uncertainty exponent.
