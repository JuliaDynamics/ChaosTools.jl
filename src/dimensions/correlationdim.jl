    kernelprob(X, ε, norm = Euclidean()) → p::Probabilities
Associate each point in `X` (`Dataset` or timesries) with a probability `p` using the
"kernel estimation" (also called "nearest neighbor kernel estimation" and other names):
```math
p_j = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N I(||X_i - X_j|| < \\epsilon)
```
where ``N`` is its length and ``I`` gives 1 if the argument is `true`.

See also [`genentropy`](@ref) and [`correlationsum`](@ref).
`kernelprob` is equivalent with `probabilities(X, NaiveKernel(ϵ, TreeDistance(norm)))`.

"""
    correlationsum(X, ε; w = 0, norm = Euclidean(), q = 2) → C_q(ε)
Calculate the `q`-order correlation sum of `X` (`Dataset` or timeseries)
for a given radius `ε` and `norm`, using the formula:
```math
C_2(\\epsilon) = \\frac{2}{(N-w)(N-w-1)}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\sum_{j=1+w+i}^{N} I(||X_i - X_j|| < \\epsilon)
```
for `q=2` and
```math
C_q(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{(N-2w)(N-2w-1)^{(q-1)}} \\sum_{i=1}^N\\left[\\sum_{j:|i-j| > w} I(||X_i - X_j|| < \\epsilon)\\right]^{q-1}
```
for `q≠2`, where ``N`` is its length and ``I`` gives 1 if the argument is
`true`. `w` is the Theiler window, a correction to the correlation sum that
skips points that are temporally close with each other, with the aim of
removing spurious correlations. If `ε` is a vector its values have to be
ordered. See the book "Nonlinear Time Series Analysis"[^Kantz2003], Ch. 6, for
a discussion around `w` and choosing best values and Ch. 11.3 for the
definition of the q-order correlationsum.

If `q = 2` and `ε` is a vector, the `correlationsum` allocates a matrix of size
`N^2`. If this is larger than your available memory please use
```julia
[correlationsum(..., ε) for ε in εs]
```

Use the method of Grassberger and Proccacia[^Grassberger1983], and the correction by
Theiler[^Theiler1986], to estimate the correlation dimension `D_C` of the given `data`.

This function does something extrely simple:
```julia
cm = correlationsum(data, εs; kwargs...)
return linear_region(log.(sizes), log(cm))[2]
```
i.e. it calculates [`correlationsum`](@ref) for various radii and then tries to find
a linear region in the plot of the log of the correlation sum versus log(ε).
See [`generalized_dim`](@ref) for a more thorough explanation.

Estimates the box assisted q-order correlation dimension[^Kantz2003] out of a
dataset `data` for radii `εs` by splitting the data into boxes of size `r0`
beforehand. If `M` is unequal to the dimension of the data, only the first `m`
dimensions are considered. The method of splitting the data into boxes was
implemented according to Theiler[^Theiler1987]. If only a dataset is given the
radii `εs` and boxsize `r0` are chosen by calculating
[`estimate_r0_buenoorovio`](@ref).

This method splits the data into boxes, calculates the q-order correlation sum
C_q(ε) for every `ε ∈ εs` and fits a line through the longest linear looking
region of the curve `(log(εs), log(C_q(εs)))`. The gradient of this line is the
dimension.

The function is explicitly optimized for `q = 2`.

Estimates a reasonable size for boxing the time series `X` proposed by
Bueno-Orovio and Pérez-García[^Bueno2007] before calculating the correlation
dimension as presented by Theiler[^Theiler1983]. If instead of boxes, prisms
are chosen everything stays the same but `M` is the dimension of the prism.
To do so the dimension `ν` is estimated by running the algorithm by Grassberger
and Procaccia[^Grassberger1983] with `√N` points where `N` is the number of
total data points.
An effective size `ℓ` of the attractor is calculated by boxing a small subset
of size `N/10` into boxes of sidelength `r_ℓ` and counting the number of filled
boxes `η_ℓ`.
```math
\\ell = r_\\ell \\eta_\\ell ^{1/\\nu}
```
The optimal number of filled boxes `η_opt` is calculated by minimising the number of calculations.
```math
\\eta_\\textrm{opt} = N^{2/3}\\cdot \\frac{3^\\nu - 1}{3^M - 1}^{1/2}.
```
`M` is the dimension of the data or the number of edges on the prism that don't
span the whole dataset.

Then the optimal boxsize ``r_0`` computes as
```math
r_0 = \\ell / \\eta_\\textrm{opt}^{1/\\nu}.

    takens_best_estimate(X, εmax, metric = Chebyshev(),εmin = 0) → D_C, D_C_95u, D_C_95l
Use the so-called "Takens' best estimate" [^Takens1985][^Theiler1988]
method for estimating the correlation dimension
`D_C` and the upper (`D_C_95u`) and lower (`D_C_95l`) confidence limit for the given dataset `X`.

The original formula is
```math
D_C \\approx \\frac{C(\\epsilon_\\text{max})}{\\int_0^{\\epsilon_\\text{max}}(C(\\epsilon) / \\epsilon) \\, d\\epsilon}
```
where ``C`` is the [`correlationsum`](@ref) and ``\\epsilon_\\text{max}`` is an upper cutoff.
Here we use the later expression
```math
D_C \\approx - \\frac{1}{\\eta},\\quad \\eta = \\frac{1}{(N-1)^*}\\sum_{[i, j]^*}\\log(||X_i - X_j|| / \\epsilon_\\text{max})
```
where the sum happens for all ``i, j`` so that ``i < j`` and ``||X_i - X_j|| < \\epsilon_\\text{max}``. In the above expression, the bias in the original paper has already been corrected, as suggested in [^Borovkova1999].

The confidence limits are estimated from the log-likelihood function by finding
the values of `D_C` where the function has fallen by 2 from its maximum, see e.g.
[^Barlow] chapter 5.3
Because the CLT does not apply (no independent measurements), the limits are not
neccesarily symmetric.

According to [^Borovkova1999], introducing a lower cutoff `εmin` can make the
algorithm more stable (no divergence), this option is given but defaults to zero.

If `X` comes from a delay coordinates embedding of a timseries `x`, a recommended value
for ``\\epsilon_\\text{max}`` is `std(x)/4`.
