"""
Main procedure motivated by Nusse & Yorke for the grid cell `n`. The algorithm can be
though as a finite state machine with five states: :att_hit, :att_search, :att_found,
:bas_hit, :lost. The transition between states depends on the current number in the
cell being visited by the trajectory of the dynamical systems. When the automata switches
to a state a counter starts and one of the following action can happen depending on the internal
counter and the input number:
* The automata stays in the same state and the counter increases.
* The automata switches to another state.
* The automata has decided upon the basin of the initial condition and returns a code corresponding
  to this basin.

The basins and attractors are coded in the array with odd numbers for the basins and even numbers
for the attractors. The attractor `2n` has the corresponding basin `2n+1`. This codification
is changed when the basins and attractors are returned to the user. Diverging trajectories
and the trajectories staying outside the grid are coded with -1.
