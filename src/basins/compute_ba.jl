    basins_map2D(xg, yg, integ; kwargs...) → basins, attractors
Compute an estimate of the basins of attraction on a two-dimensional plane using a map
of the plane onto itself according to the method of Nusse & Yorke[^Yorke1997].
The dynamical system should be a discrete two dimensional system such as:
* Discrete 2D map.
* 2D poincaré map.
* A 2D stroboscopic map.
For a higher-dimensional dynamical system, use [`basins_general`](@ref).

`integ` is an istance of an integrator, not a `DynamicalSystem`. This includes
the output of [`poincaremap`](@ref). See documentation online for examples for all cases!
`xg`, `yg` are 1-dimensional ranges that define the grid of the initial conditions
to test.
The output `basins` is a matrix on the grid (`xg, yg`), see below for details.
The output `attractors` is a dictionary whose keys correspond to the attractor number and
the values contains the points of the attractors found on the map. Notice that for some
attractors this list may be incomplete.

See also [`basin_fractions`](@ref), [`tipping_probabilities`](@ref).

[^Yorke1997]: H. E. Nusse and J. A. Yorke, Dynamics: numerical explorations Ch. 7, Springer, New York, 1997

## Keyword Arguments
* `T` : Period of the stroboscopic map, in case `integ` is an integrator of a 2D continuous
  dynamical system with periodic time forcing.
* `mc_att = 10`: A parameter that sets the maximum checks of consecutives hits of an attractor
  before deciding the basin of the initial condition.
* `mc_bas = 10` : Maximum check of consecutive visits of the same basin of attraction. This number
  can be increased for higher accuracy.
* `mc_unmb = 60` : Maximum check of unnumbered cell before considering we have an attractor. This number
  can be increased for higher accuracy.

## Description
This method identifies the attractors and their basins of attraction on the grid without
prior knowledge about the system. At the end of a successfull computation the function
returns a matrix coding the basins of attraction and a dictionary with all attractors found.

`basins` has the following organization:
* The basins are coded in sequential order from 1 to the number of attractors `Na` .
* If the trajectory diverges or converges to an attractor outside the defined grid it is
  numbered `-1`

`attractors` has the following organization:
* The keys of the dictionary correspond to the number of the attractor.
* The value associated to a key is a [`Dataset`](@ref) with the *guessed* location of the
  attractor on the plane.

The method starts by picking the first available initial condition on the plane not yet
numbered. The dynamical system is then iterated until one of the following conditions
happens:
1. The trajectory hits a known attractor already numbered: the initial condition is
   numbered with corresponding odd number.
1. The trajectory diverges or hits an attractor outside the defined grid: the initial
   condition is set to -1
1. The trajectory hits a known basin `mc_bas` times in a row: the initial condition belongs to
   that basin and is numbered accordingly.
1. The trajectory hits `mc_unmb` times in a row an unnumbered cell: it is considered an attractor
   and is labelled with a even number.

Regarding performace, this method is at worst as fast as tracking the attractors.
In most cases there is a signicative improvement in speed.
