    AttractorsViaRecurrences(ds::GeneralizedDynamicalSystem, grid::Tuple; kwargs...)
Map initial conditions to attractors by identifying attractors on the fly based on
recurrences in the state space, as outlined by Datseris & Wagemakers[^Datseris2022].
Works for any case encapsulated by [`GeneralizedDynamicalSystem`](@ref).
The version [`AttractorsViaRecurrencesSparse`](@ref) should practically always be
preferred over this one.

`grid` is a tuple of ranges partitioning the state space so that a finite state
machine can operate on top of it. For example
`grid = (xg, yg)` where `xg = yg = range(-5, 5; length = 100)` for a two-dimensional
system. The grid has to be the same dimensionality as the state space, use a
[`projected_integrator`](@ref) if you want to search for attractors in a lower
dimensional subspace.

## Keyword Arguments
* `Δt`: Approximate time step of the integrator, which is `1` for discrete systems.
  For continuous systems, an automatic value is calculated using
  [`automatic_Δt_basins`](@ref).
* `Ttr = 0`: This keyword arguments allows to skip a transient before the recurrence
  routine begins. It is useful for some high dimensional systems to speed up the
  convergence to the attractor.
* `diffeq = NamedTuple()`: Keyword arguments propagated to [`integrator`](@ref). Only
  valid for `ContinuousDynamicalSystem`. It is recommended to choose high accuracy
  solvers for this application, e.g. `diffeq = (alg=Vern9(), reltol=1e-9, abstol=1e-9)`.
* `mx_chk_att = 2`: A parameter that sets the maximum checks of consecutives hits of
  an attractor before deciding the basin of the initial condition.
* `mx_chk_hit_bas = 10`: Maximum check of consecutive visits of the same basin of
  attraction. This number can be increased for higher accuracy.
* `mx_chk_fnd_att = 100`: Maximum check of unnumbered cell before considering we have
  an attractor. This number can be increased for higher accuracy.
* `mx_chk_loc_att = 100`: Maximum check of consecutive cells marked as an attractor
  before considering that we have all the available pieces of the attractor.
* `mx_chk_lost = 20`: Maximum check of iterations outside the defined grid before we
  consider the orbit lost outside. This number can be increased for higher accuracy.
* `horizon_limit = 1e6`: If the norm of the integrator state reaches this
  limit we consider that the orbit diverges.
* `safety_counter_max = Int(1e6)`: A safety counter that is always increasing for
  each initial condition. Once exceeded, the algorithm assigns `-1` and throws a warning.
  This clause exists to stop the algorithm never haulting for innappropriately defined grids,
  where a found attractor may intersect in the same cell with a new attractor the orbit
  traces (which leads to infinite resetting of all counters). As this check comes with a
  performance deficit, the keyword `unsafe=true` can be set to disable it in case the user
  is confident the algorithm will hault.

## Description
An initial condition given to an instance of `AttractorsViaRecurrences` is iterated
based on the integrator corresponding to `ds`. A recurrence in the state space means
that the trajectory has converged to an attractor. This is the basis for finding attractors.

A finite state machine (FSM) follows the
trajectory in the state space, and constantly maps it to the given `grid`. The FSM
decides when an initial condition has successfully converged into an attractor. An array,
internally called "basins", stores the state of the FSM on the grid, according to the
indexing system described in [^Datseris2022]. As the system is integrated more and more,
the information of the "basins" becomes richer and richer with more identified attractors
or with grid cells that belong to basins of already found attractors.
Notice that only in the special method
`basins_of_attraction(mapper::AttractorsViaRecurrences)` the information of the
attraction or exit basins is utilized. In other functions like `basins_fractions`
only the attractor locations are utilized.

The iteration of a given initial condition continues until one of the following happens:
1. The trajectory hits `mx_chk_fnd_att` times in a row grid cells previously visited:
   it is considered that an attractor is found and is labelled with a new number.
1. The trajectory hits an already identified attractor `mx_chk_att` consecutive times:
   the initial condition is numbered with the attractor's number.
1. The trajectory hits a known basin `mx_chk_hit_bas` times in a row: the initial condition
   belongs to that basin and is numbered accordingly.
1. The trajectory spends `mx_chk_lost` steps outside the defined grid or the norm
   of the integrator state becomes > than `horizon_limit`: the initial
   condition is set to -1.
1. If none of the above happens and `unsafe=true`, the algorithm will error.

This is a special method of `basins_of_attraction` that using recurrences does
_exactly_ what is described in the paper by Datseris & Wagemakers[^Datseris2022].
By enforcing that the internal grid of `mapper` is the same as the grid of initial
conditions to map to attractors, the method can further utilize found exit and attraction
basins, making the computation faster as the grid is processed more and more.

This is done by evaluating the dynamic rule `f` (vector field) at `N` randomly chosen

Notice that `Δt` should not be too small which happens typically if the grid resolution

But if `Δt` is too small the default values for all other keywords such

Also, `Δt` that is smaller than the internal step size of the integrator will cause
