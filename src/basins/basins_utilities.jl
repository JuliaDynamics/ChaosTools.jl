    basins_fractions(basins::AbstractArray) → fs::Dict
Calculate the state space fraction of the basins of attraction encoded in `basins`.
The elements of `basins` are integers, enumerating the attractor that the entry of
`basins` converges to (i.e., like the output of [`basins_of_attraction`](@ref)).
Return a dictionary that maps attractor IDs to their relative fractions.

In[^Menck2013] the authors use these fractions to quantify the stability of a basin of
attraction, and specifically how it changes when a parameter is changed.
For this, see [`basins_fractions_continuation`](@ref).
