    linear_regions(x, y; dxi::Int = 1, tol = 0.2) -> (lrs, tangents)
Identify regions where the curve `y(x)` is linear, by scanning the
`x`-axis every `dxi` indices sequentially
(e.g. at `x[1] to x[5], x[5] to x[10], x[10] to x[15]` and so on if `dxi=5`).

If the slope (calculated via linear regression) of a region of width `dxi` is
approximatelly equal to that of the previous region,
within tolerance `tol`,
then these two regions belong to the same linear region.

Return the indices of `x` that correspond to linear regions, `lrs`,
and the _correct_ `tangents` at each region
(obtained via a second linear regression at each accumulated region).
