    uncertainty_exponent(xg, yg, basins::Matrix; kwargs...) -> ε, f_ε ,α
Estimate the uncertainty exponent[^Grebogi1983] of the basins of attraction. This exponent
is related to the final state sensitivity of the trajectories in the phase space.
An exponent close to `1` means basins with smooth boundaries whereas an exponent close
to `0` represent complety fractalized basins, also called riddled basins.

`xg`, `yg` are 1-dim ranges that defines the grid of the initial conditions.
`basins` is the matrix containing the information of the basin, i.e. the output of
[`basins_2D`](@ref) or [`basins_general`](@ref).

The output `f_ε` is a vector with the fraction of the balls of radius `ε` (in pixels)
that contain at least two initial conditions that lead to different attractors.
The ouput `α` is the estimation of the uncertainty exponent of the basins of attraction
by fitting a line in the `log.(f_ε)` vs `log.(ε)` curve, however it is recommended to
analyze the curve directly for more accuracy.

## Keyword arguments
* `precision = 1e-5` is the variance of the estimator of the uncertainty function.
  Values between `1e-7` and `1e-5` brings reasonable results.
* `max_ε = floor(Int, length(xg)/20)` is the maximum size in pixels of the ball to test.

## Description

A phase space with a fractal boundary may cause a uncertainty on the final state of the
dynamical system for a given initial condition. A measure of this final state sensitivity
is the uncertainty exponent. The algorithm probes the basin of attraction with balls
of size `ε` at random. If there are a least two initial conditions that lead to different
attractors, a ball is tagged "uncertain". `f_ε` is the fraction of "uncertain balls" to the
total number of tries in the basin. In analogy to the fractal dimension, there is a scaling
law between, `f_ε ~ ε^α`. The number that characterizes this scaling is called the
uncertainty exponent `α`.

Notice that the uncertainty exponent and the box counting dimension of the boundary are
related. We have `Δ₀ = 2 - α` where `Δ₀` is the box counting dimension,
