# Utility functions for managing dictionary keys that are useful
# in continuation and attractor matching business
# Thanks a lot to Valentin (@Seelengrab) for generous help in the key swapping code.
# Swapping keys and ensuring that everything works "as expected" is,
# surprising, one of the hardest things to code in ChaosTools.jl.

    swap_dict_keys!(d::Dict, replacement_map::Dict)

Swap the keys of a dictionary `d` given the [`replacement_map`](@ref)
which maps old keys to new keys. Also ensure that a swap can happen at most once,
e.g., if input `d` has a key `4`, and `rmap = Dict(4 => 3, 3 => 2)`,
then the key `4` will be transformed to `3` and not further to `2`.

Given a vector of dictionaries with various positive integer keys, retract all keys so that
