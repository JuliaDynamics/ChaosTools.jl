Compute the fraction of points inside a region of state space which go to each existing basin
of attraction. They are calculated by integrating trajectories of the given 
dynamical system `ds`, starting from initial conditions (ICs) given in `ics` and classifying 
their respective steady-states using clustering algorithms. This clustering is done by
by extracting features from the trajectories using the `feature_extraction` function and
then identifying clusters of features as an attractor [^Stender2021].
The function returns the fraction of initial conditions ending up at each identified attractor,
 along with the labels given to each initial condition, if `ics` is a Dataset.

The dynamical system `ds` can be either `DiscreteDynamicalSystem` or
`ContinuousDynamicalSystem`. `ics` contains the initial conditions, and can either a `Dataset`
of a `Function`. As a `Dataset`, `ics` already contains the initial conditions to be used,
with each row being the IC for each trajectory. Starting from a Matrix `M`, `ics` can be
generated as `ics = Dataset(M)`. As a `Function`, `ics()` generates an IC
on the spot. See [`sampler`](@ref) for convenience functions to generate `ics()`. 
Uniform, randomly spaced ICs guarantees that the basin fractions values calculated are 
proportional to the true basins' volume as the number of initial conditions goes to infinity,
and so are an estimate of the basin's global stability.
For nonuniform ICs, the fractions simply indicate the probabilities for observing each specific 
steady-state.(see [^Stender2021] for more discussions).

The `feature_extraction` function receives as input a trajectory vector `u`, the time vector, and
optional parameters, to return an array `Array{Float64, 1}` containing the features extracted from `u`.
Finally, `ic_templates` is a `Dataset`, containing in its rows the initial conditions for
the templates, to which the features are matched in the "supervised" clustering method.
If not provided, the "unsupervised" clustering method is used.

The output `S` is a dictionary whose keys are the labels given to each attractor, and the values
are their respective global stability. The label `-1` is given to any initial condition whose
attractor could not be identified. The `class_labels` output is an array of size `N`
containing the label of each initial condition given in `ics`.


## Keyword arguments
### Integration
* `T = 100` : total time for evolving initial conditions (after transient)
* `Ttr = 0` : transient time to evolve initial conditions
* `Δt = 1` : Integration time step, Δt = 1/fs, fs being the sampling frequency used in the
  bSTAB paper
* `diffeq = NamedTuple()` : other parameters for the solvers of DiffEqs
* `num_samples` : Number of sample initial conditions to generate. Used only if `ics` is a
`Function`.
* `seed_sampling = 1` : The seed for the random number generator used in generating the initial
conditions. Used only if `ics` is a `Function`.
### Feature extraction and classification
*`clust_method_norm=Euclidean()` : metric to be used in the clustering in the supervised
    method; 
* `extract_params = NamedTuple()`  : optional parameters for the `feature_extraction` function.
* `clust_method_norm = "kNN"` : (supervised method only) which clusterization method to
    apply. If `"kNN"`, the first-neighbor clustering is used. If `"kNN_thresholded"`, a
    subsequent step is taken, which considers as unclassified (label `-1`) the features
    whose distance to the nearest template above the `clustering_threshold`.
* `clustering_threshold = 0.0` : ("supervised" method, with `kNN_thresholded` only). Maximum
   allowed distance between a feature and the cluster center for it to be considered inside 
    the cluster. Used when `clust_method = kNN_thresholded`;
* `min_neighbors = 10` : (unsupervised method only) minimum number of neighbors
    (i.e. of similar features) each feature needs to have in order to be considered in a
    cluster (fewer than this, it is labeled as an outlier,  id=-1). This number is somewhat hard
     to define, as it directly interferes with how many attractors the clustering finds.
     The authors use it equal to 10 always.

## Description
Let ``F(A)`` be the fraction of initial conditions in a region of state space
``\\mathcal{S}``, given by `ics`, which are in the basin of attraction of an attractor
``A``. `basin_fractions` estimates ``F`` for attractors in
``\\mathcal{S}`` by counting which initial conditions end up in which attractors. To do
this, it evolves each trajectory `u` for `T` times past an initial transient `Ttr`, values
which have to be large enough to guarantee the trajectory ends up in its steady state. This
steady state trajectory `u` is then transformed in a vector of features, extracted using the
user-defined `feature_extraction` function. Each feature is a number useful in
characterizing the trajectory and distinguishing it from trajectories in other attrators.
For instance, a useful feature distinguishing a stable node from a stable limit cycle is the
standard deviation of `u` (zero for the node, nonzero for the limit cycle). The vectors of
features are then used to identify to which attractor each trajectory belongs (i.e. in which
basin of attractor each initial condition is in). The algorithm presents two methods to do
this. In the supervised method, the attractors are known to the user, which provides one
initial condition for each attractor in the region. The algorithm then evolves these initial
conditions, extracts their features, and uses them as templates representing the attrators.
Each trajectory is considered to belong to the nearest template, which it finds using the
first-neighbor clustering algorithm.

If the attractors are not as well-known, the alternative, unsupervised method, can be
used. It maps the vectors of features to an attractor by analysing how the features are
clustered in the feature space. Using the DBSCAN algorithm, it identifies these clusters
of features, and considers each cluster to represent an attractor. Features whose attractor
is not identified are labeled as `-1`. Otherwise, they are labeled starting from `1` in
crescent order.

These labels are then returned by the algorithm, along with the fraction ``F(A)`` for each
label (attractor). The sampling error associated with this method is given by[^Stender2021]
``e = \\sqrt{F(A)(1-F(A))/N}``, with ``N`` denoting the number of initial conditions, if the uniform
random sampling is used in `ics`.

#------ CLASSIFICATION OF FEATURES

"""
`classify_solution` is the supervised method for classifying the trajectories, identifying
to which attractor they belong. It receives the matrix `features` of features, containing in
each column the features from one particular initial condition, and also receives the matrix
`templates`, containing in each column one template of features. The classification is done
using a first-neighbor clustering method `clust_method`, identifying, for each vector of
features, the closest template.

If `clust_method = "kNN_thresholded`, the vectors of features whose classification error is
bigger than the threshold `clustering_threshold` receive label `-1` and are considered
unclassified. The default metric `clust_method_norm` used in the clustering is Euclidean,
but other options can also be used, such as seuclidean, cityblock, chebychev, minkowski,
mahalanobis, cosine, correlation, spearman, hamming, jaccard [^Stender2021]. Typically,
these are subtypes of `<:Metric` from Distances.jl.

Returns:
* `class_labels = Array{Int64,1}`, containing the labels for each vector of features (each
  initial condition). The label is the id of the closest template, which is itself that
  template's column index in `templates`. Unnclassified features, for which the error is
  bigger than threshold if `clust_method="kNN_thresholded"` receive label `-1`.
* `class_errors = Array{Float64,1}` with the errors for each vector of features. The error
  is the distance from the vector of features to its closest template (in the specified
  metric) `clust_method_norm`.
